## PolygonAutomation
Manipulating geospatial data to generate a polygon using Python.
The input is KML and the output will be in GeoJSON. 
The KML of a Driving route must be drawn using Google My Maps, while a Train route can be scraped only by initialing the coordinates of the origin and destination.

## PolygonMerge
In some cases, the KML file must be separated into different files first.
This additional algorithm will merge the polygons.
