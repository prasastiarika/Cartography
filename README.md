# PolygonAutomation
Manipulating geospatial data to generate a polygon using Python.
The input is KML and the output will be in GeoJSON. 
KML of the driving route must be drawn using Google My Maps, while the Train route can be scraped only by initialing the coordinates of the origin and destination.

# PolygonMerge
In some cases, the KML file must be separated into different files first.
This additional algorithm will merge the polygons.
